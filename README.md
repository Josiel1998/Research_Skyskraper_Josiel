## Introduction
There are many factors that can cause investors to buy or sell shares of a company stock; some factors include legislative decisions, inflation, financial statements, and even company rumors. Due to these events, predicting the movement of a company stock price becomes difficult as it is dependent on an investorâ€™s reaction to the events. The goal of this research is to perform sentiment analysis of earning conference calls and journalistic reporting language using machine learning to understand the impact it will have on the company stock movement. Sentiment analysis will be used to understand whether a message, either via earning conference call or journalistic reporting is either positive, neutral, or negative. The research aims to answer the following research questions:
- Do investors make decisions on the purchase or sale of company shares based on the sentiment of information? 
- How does journalistic reporting language impact the company price movement?
- Does journalistic reporting sentiment supersede impact of earning conference call sentiments?
- Does earning conference call sentiment supersede impact of journalistic sentiments? 

Earning conference call data has been targeted for this research due to the exposure investors will have to the company performance by receiving information targeted towards institutional investor, individual investor, and financial analysts (Beers, 2020). Furthermore, journalistic reporting has been targeted as a source for identifying company news, daily, from reputable media companies, reporters, and analysts. The expectation of the research is to evaluate if investors react to information and then manipulate the supply-demand curve through selling or buying shares, which in return will change the company stock price.
