i.e.: the folder contains `SentiStrengthCom.jar`. 
The language files should be in folders with 2-letter ISO

**Sentistrength java file can be obtained from sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/ by emailing Professor Thelwall (address on website)**

Example use (single-core client):

```python
>>> from senti_client import sentistrength
>>> senti = sentistrength('EN')
>>> res = senti.get_sentiment('I love using sentistrength!')
>>> print(res)

... {'negative': '-1', 'neutral': '1', 'positive': '4'}
```


Example use (multi-core client):

```python
>>> from senti_client import multisent
>>> ms    = multisent('EN')
>>> texts = ['This is great!!'] * 10000
>>> res   = ms.run_batch(texts) # push all texts and get the results in one go
>>> print(res[0])

... {'negative': '-1', 'neutral': '1', 'positive': '4'}
# OR, if you do not want all texts & results in memory
>>> res   = ms.run_stream(texts) # pushes texts one-at-a-time for out-of-memory processing
>>> for i in res:
>>>     print(i) # do what you want

... {'negative': '-1', 'neutral': '1', 'positive': '4'}
```

Enjoy!
